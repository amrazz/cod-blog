## 🛠️ Development Background

CodBlog started as a personal project to rebuild confidence after a long break from development. It served as both a **skill refresher** and a **technical challenge** to implement real-world application logic using:

- **Class-based views** for complex business logic
- **Nested model relationships** for social features
- **Real-time communication** using WebSockets
- **AI integration** for content enhancement
- **Modern frontend practices** with React and Redux

The project later evolved into a collaborative effort, incorporating advanced features like Redis-based real-time notifications and comprehensive social networking capabilities.

## 🚀 Performance & Scalability

### Current Optimizations
- **Database indexing** for faster queries
- **Redis caching** for session management
- **Lazy loading** for improved frontend performance
- **Pagination** for large datasets
- **Optimized API responses** with serializers

### Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal scaling** ready with Redis
- **Database connection pooling**
- **Static file serving** optimization
- 

## 🔒 Security Features

- **JWT token authentication** with refresh mechanism
- **CORS configuration** for secure cross-origin requests
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **SQL injection** protection through Django ORM
- **XSS protection** with content security policies
- **Rate limiting** for API endpoints
